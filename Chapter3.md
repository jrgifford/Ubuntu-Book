#Chapter 3: Installing Software.

We'll be installing the Chromium web browser for this demo.

For a (possibly) updated version of this, take a look at
the [original Ask Ubuntu Question.](http://askubuntu.com/questions/66447/how-do-i-install-software-using-the-ubuntu-software-center)

##Step one: Open the Ubuntu Software Center.

To do that, open the Dash and then search for the “Ubuntu Software Center”,
as shown below:

Now, search for “Chromium” in the search bar, like below:

Click the “More info” button, and then you should see this:

Now, you can click the “Install” button, and it will ask you for your password:

Enter in your password, and then wait for it to install. Once it is installed,
it will show something like this:

After that, you should be good to go! You can change “Chromium” to almost
anything, the instructions are the same for most software.
