#Chapter 5: Ubuntu One and Cloudy Stuff.

Half-completed, needs screenshots, and a walkthrough of Ubuntu One on 12.04.

So, you’re in need of some file backup, right?

Time for..... (drum roll please?) UBUNTU ONE!

Ubuntu One comes with Ubuntu by default, and it is the only service 
that has everything included by default. 
So, what is Ubuntu One, and what can it do for me?

- File sync across platforms
- Give you 5 GB of Storage (free!)
- Share folders and files (Even with the public)
- Access on your mobile (with an app)
- Access music in the cloud from anywhere (paid service)
- Provides an API for integration with other applications

...and with the wonderful Application integration provided with Ubuntu One, 
you also get:

- The ability to sync any (and all) files in your home folder
- Firefox bookmark sync
- Have your Deja Dup backups go straight to “The Cloud”
- Have your Tomboy Notes sync with Ubuntu One
