#Chapter 6: Getting Under The Hood of Ubuntu.

*Do note that this is in need of screenshots. Will add soon.*

You have two options for tweaking your system past what is available in the default settings:

- Ubuntu Tweak, 
- Gnome Tweak Tool.
 
Both are good, but I’ll only be covering the Ubuntu Tweak side of things, just for simplicity, since Gnome Tweak Tool also brings in some extra software that is beyond the scope of this book, while Ubuntu Tweak is simple, and does it well.

Open up a terminal (Super/Windows key, then type in “Terminal”) and run the following:

`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/next`

You’ll see something like this:


`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak -y`

Once you’ve done that, you’ll be able to launch Ubuntu Tweak by opening the dash (The Super/Windows key) and then typing in “Ubuntu Tweak”.

Then, you’ll be presented with this:

You’ll notice that it tells you some basic information about your hardware, and it tells you some information about your actual computer - primarily your hostname (the computers name), your Ubuntu Version (in this case, Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric) and your desktop enviroment - in the screenshot, I was running Unity 2D.

Click the “Tweaks” tab. You’ll see something like this:


Lets go tweak the menubar a bit.

By default, it looks something like this:


We want to remove the “James Gifford” (of course substituting your name instead of mine) from the menubar - it gets somewhat annoying, particularly on a netbooks display.

Click the “Session Control” option in the “Tweaks” section.

You’ll see this:


Uncheck the “Show user’s real name on the panel” option that has the big red arrow next to it.

Logout, and then log back in. 

To logout, click the little power cog in the top right hand corner, and select the logout option:


Now, your name will be gone from the menubar.



Now, lets tweak Unity itself.

If you’re logged in using Ubuntu, or Unity 3D (they are the same thing, just the two different names they go under), you’re going to have some options for the Unity launcher.


So, you can change the Icon size, the launcher opacity, the launcher hide mode and the launcher “reveal edge timeout”.

Feel free to play around with this - if you press the little button on the far right, it will reset that option.
