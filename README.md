#Forward

Travel back with me to the year 2010. A young, brash teenager gets a netbook,
and doesn’t want to use Windows 7 Starter edition on it (there might have been
a Dad saying “I won’t help you when you have issues” somewhere in there).

So he downloads Ubuntu 10.04 LTS netbook remix, and is immediately lost in the
sea of all the forums, noise and “Getting started with Ubuntu!” blog posts.

This is an attempt to prevent that from happening to another person.

Yeah, there are projects like the Ubuntu Manual - but the goal of this isn’t to
make “**The** Ubuntu Manual”, but rather to create a short and sweet booklet
about getting started with Ubuntu.

<sub>Another goal is to keep it up-to-date, and have the next release of Ubuntu
covered before release day, something that most projects struggle with.</sub>


###Contributing.

So, do you want to contribute? Here’s how it works:

  - File a bug report with a cool chapter idea. Keep in mind the following:
    - This is for beginners. We’re not talking about “How to compile a Kernel
      101” here, we’re talking “How can I use my Ubuntu desktop”.
    - Keep it short if you can.
  - Once I’ve given you the go-ahead for the chapter on the bug report, then go
    ahead and write it.
  - Once it’s written, feel free to submit a pull request in Git. Make sure of
    the following:
    - That the chapter is written in proper markdown.
    - That the chapter is added to the `TableOfContents.md` file.
    - That it is called `Chapter#{NUMBER}.md`.
    - That if required, it has screenshots.
    - Please use proper punctuation.

###Translations.

Right now, translations are a no-no. In the future, perhaps we’ll look into
translations, but right now it’s a no.
